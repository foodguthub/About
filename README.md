# About

Fermentation. Some associate it with rot, with decay. But we see beyond. We've seen the benefits it's had on health for the past generations, and we believe in providing that privilege for the generations to come. GutHub is a community of tinkerers and bacteria enthusiasts fermenting our way to better guts. We hope to build some fruitful gut connections and facilitate a community where like-minded people share their passion and discoveries of all-things-fermenting.

GutHub is a social platform for online - offline exchanges of fermentation starter cultures and knowledge related to the practice of fermentation. The Singaporean GutHub community hangs out at (likely-to-be-regular) meetups in [Hackerspace.sg](http://hackerspace.sg/) and in the [GutHub Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/guthub/). 

In the Hackerspace, we have a nice Fermentation Bank (i.e. a fridge stuffed with starter cultures for free sharing) and tinker with various gizmo and tools, such as the Mother 0.1. starter incubator, or the [StarterSwarm map](http://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=zCoDc3SSi24I.korG11Dfhm4A) listing locations where people offer starters for sharing. This Github serves as a scrapbook of recipes, tutorials and other things-to-be-forked around fermentation.

The project is an experiment in HCI (human-computer interaction) performed beyond the anthropocentric limits, while promoting a technologically mediated human-to-bacteria interplay. The goal of the GutHub initiative is to test the usability of peer-sharing economy and open collaboration the support local DIY food production in Singapore.
